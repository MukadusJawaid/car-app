<b>Electric Vehicles (EVs)</b> are powered solely by electricity and produce <u>zero tailpipe emissions</u>. They offer quiet rides, lower maintenance costs, and growing public charging infrastructure. However, <i>range anxiety</i> and charging time can still be concerns for those without regular access to charging stations.<br /><br />

<b>Hybrids</b>, on the other hand, blend a gasoline engine with an electric motor. This gives drivers the best of both worlds: <u>improved fuel efficiency</u> and the convenience of refueling at any gas station. While they don’t eliminate emissions entirely, hybrids can be a more practical option for those who do a lot of long-distance driving or live in areas without much EV infrastructure.<br /><br />
